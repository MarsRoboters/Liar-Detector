A questionnaire is developed in order to identify possible victims of mobbing, the Negative Acts Questionnaire-Revised (NAQ-R).

Individuals taking the questionnaire are asked to follow different instructions: a group of non-victim of mobbing take the questionnaire two times, the first time they are asked to answer honestly, while the second time they are asked to pretend to be victims of mobbing. The second group of subjects are actual victims of mobbing and they are asked to take the test while answering honestly.

Our task is to develop a method that will allow us to predict with a certain level of accuracy whether a person taking the questionnaire is really a a victim of mobbing or if it is just pretending to be one.

In short we are trying to construct a classifier that can be able to distinguish between dishonest (D) and pathological (P) subjects.
