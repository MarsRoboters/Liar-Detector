NAQ-R
Object: Mobbing
Number of Item: 22
Likert Scale: 1-5
Participants: 
Honest: 356
Faker: 356
Clinical: 176

Study Design: Within subject
Procedure: It was asked to subjects to answer twice a questionnaire developed to identify possible victims of mobbing, the Negative Acts Questionnaire-Revised (NAQ-R), following different instructions: the first time by answering honestly, while the second time by pretending to be victims of mobbing.
Therefore, each participant responded twice, once honestly (H) and once faking (D). We also collected data from people whose questionnaire scores exceeded the cut-off (P). Of these, we have the data in the honest condition.
FAKING BAD: we expect liars will give higher responses than truth-tellers because they have to exaggerate bullying symptoms
